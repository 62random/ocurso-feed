This little python script allows me to receive all the messages posted in a [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) forum through Facebook Messenger (using a bot).

The script runs at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and the HTTP requests are generated automaticly by the Discourse installation.

I later added a functionality to process the posts' text to trigger a bot that stores data in a google sheet and posts in the forum.
